gcc -l links with a library file
gcc -L looks in directory for library files
gcc -I adds include directory of header files

what libraries should gcc specify when compiling
for -I 	JAVA_HOME/include
	
for -L 	JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/jli
	JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/server //this directory should be included always

for -l	jli
	jvm //this directory should be included always

maybe jli is not needed.
